Executive Summary
On January 21, 2016, Digitech Inc. was called in to assist the National Gallery, Washington D.C. (NGDC) case involving the conspiracy associated with the theft of valuable stamps and defacing of museums are at the NGDC. 

Tracy is a suspect in the aforementioned conspiracy
As part of the investigation, Tracy’s iPhone was taken into custody
Digitech, Inc. was tasked with investigating evidence relevant to the aforementioned conspiracy

As described fully in the report, Digitech, Inc. made the following findings:

Digitech, Inc found evidence to suggest that Tracy is using an alias “King”
 
Alex is a Krasnovian supporter who wishes to embarrass the United States. He lives outside the United States, presumably in a region called Krasnovia.


He knows Carry through extended family connections, and contacts her.


He plans to deface foreign works that are on exhibit at the National Gallery in DC. Defacing the artwork will embarrass the United States and possibly degrade the relationship between the United States and the foreign country.


Carry is a somewhat criminally involved individual and Krasnovian supporter who shares family ties with Alex.


Carry is tech savvy and an occasional social media user. She is contacted by Alex in the beginning of the scenario and asked to orchestrate the defacing of the artwork because she is both aligned with Krasnovia and has "connections".


She is acquainted with Tracy


Tracy works as a supervisor at the National Gallery.


Carry contacts Tracy and starts sending her small pieces of data, telling Tracy that she wants to organize a flash mob at the gallery and needs a little help.


Carry offers to give Tracy money for this help. The items transferred are suspicious but not outright illegal. Tracy is having trouble with finances and this allows her to overlook the suspicious nature of the requests.


Joe is currently going through a divorce with Tracy.


Joe is financially well-off and still bitter about the issues in their marriage.


Now that Joe and Tracy are going through a divorce, he has motivation to use the keylogger to spy on both Tracy and Terry, their daughter.


He previously installed a keylogger on the family's MacBook Air in an attempt to keep track of Terry's online behavior.


Joe used to have an account on the MacBook Air, but it was deleted. The home folder may have been preserved.


Pat is a police officer in the D.C. Enforcers Bureau and Tracy's brother. He holds the status of detective and is very devoted to his sister and his niece Terry.

Equipment and Tools
The seized evidence included an iPhone and a tablet. The copy of the device storage contains operating system data, file system data, applications, documents, pictures, videos, and music.
Digitech,Inc. looked for evidence related to the case, including:
SMS messages that show intent to commit a crime
IP address information that indicates GPS location data alongside timestamp
Emails and email addresses that contain incriminating evidence
EQUIPMENT:  FLASH MEMORY
Following equipment was used in this investigation:
An iPhone (Flash memory) drive 
Flash Storage devices have no moving parts and use flash memory, allowing for quicker read and write access.  Flash memory or flash storage is non-volatile, meaning it holds data even when it's not connected to power. This technology is used in devices such as USB drives, mobile phones, cameras, and tablet computers.
In an iPhone, this will recover deleted messages as well as GPS coordinates and cell tower locations.
Data on confiscated equipment, such as:
Emails
Images
Text messages
Phone logs
Browsing history
The following directories contain evidence applicable to the Tracy iPhone investigation:

	/mobile
/Applications
/Library
/root
/Logs
/logs
Phones allow users to back up their data to the cloud, which could be another source of data in an investigation.  During an investigation, we maintain integrity of data making sure that evidence is not contaminated.  Our team of forensic investigators imaged the data. 
IMPORTANT!
To preserve the integrity of digital evidence, a bit-level copy, not the original media, was used by Digitech, Inc. for analysis.
A bit-level copy
A bit-stream image captures all created sections of a hard drive, known as partitions, whether used or not, and all unallocated drive space that doesn’t belong to partitions.
This method allows our team of forensic examiners to recover deleted files and fragments of data that may exist on a hard drive.
A bit-level copy or bit-stream image copies over everything slack space, deleted files, and the regular files as well.
TOOLS:
The following tools were used in this investigation:
Autopsy 4.16.0 Digital Forensics Suite Sleuthkit Autopsy Forensic Application
Autopsy is an open source graphical interface to The Sleuth Kit and other digital forensics tools.


SQLite DB Browser DB Browser for SQLite
DB Browser for SQLite (DB4S) is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.

King,
Long time no see… I have a juicy proposition for you.  Two weeks from now, me and my associates are planning a heist at the national gallery.  
Although, we need a helping hand.  I know that you are on parole right now and are probably hesitant to participate.  Me and your parole officer go years back.  He is a very strict fellow.  If we were to find out that you were dealing with drugs and shooting dope in your veins every night, i feel he wouldn=92t be too happy.  It=92s very easy for a person to phone the feds an anonymous tip that you are on drugs and the location of your stash.  All they have to do is give you a drug test and since you’re on parole, the feds don=92t need a search warrant.  Well hit me up.  You know where to find me.
